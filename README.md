# Java-Training_01_Hello-world

In this first tutorial, we will just create a new Java project to print a "Hello, World!" message in the console.

## Steps

1. create a new Java Program (In IntelliJ, select the SDK and don't use any template)
2. create a new Hello.java class
3. Add a public static void main method
4. Print the message by using the System.out.println method
5. Execute the program
- by clicking on the IntelliJ Run button
- by manually compiling and executing the java program
  - javac Hello.java
  - java Hello (you have to be in the class folder to execute it)
